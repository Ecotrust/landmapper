Landowners often spend days or weeks navigating a dozen or more websites, learning new software, or visiting local offices to gather maps and tables describing their property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our focus with this tool is to provide a free and open-source web app that enables users across the state to click on tax lots and have relevant maps and tables for stewardship planning auto-generate and be immediately available for print or download.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Questions?
